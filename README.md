## What Youtube Dl Firefox Addon does

This is a firefox addon to which downloads youtube videos using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).

You can configure youtube-dl to download only audio, or convert into any desired format after installing, or even download full youtube playlists. These options are controlled via youtube-dl's own [configuration](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#configuration)

## Prerequisites

1. Needs [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) installed.
1. Needs python installed.
1. This has only been tested on Ubuntu linux, but should ideally work on all platforms where youtube-dl works. You will need to change the path for the `firefox_command_runner.json` for other platforms.

## How to install Youtube Dl Firefox Addon

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the add on from [Firefox Addons Website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-dl-for-linux/). Or you can install the addon [command_runner-1.0-an+fx-linux.xpi](./command_runner-1.0-an+fx-linux.xpi?raw=true) from this repo to firefox by double-clicking.
3. Edit the [local youtube-dl config](config) to fit your needs or delete it to use youtube-dl's global configuration
4. Run `./preinstall.py` (from the root of the downloaded code repository) to create required accessory files, or _instead_ do the two following steps by hand:

4-alt-1. Edit the file [firefox_command_runner.json](./app/firefox_command_runner.json) and edit the `path` to the location of the file `./app/firefox-command-runner.py` (i.e., where you cloned this repo to.).

4-alt-2. Copy the file `firefox_command_runner.json` to the folder `/home/<username>/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/` (replace `<username>` wtih your own username. Create the folder if it does not exist).

## How to use this addon

1. Go to any youtube video page
1. Press the addon's logo in the toolbar once. (The logo looks like a YouTube icon).
1. The video will be downloaded automatically in the background.
1. After the download is finished, you will get a notification saying the download has finished. For the download locations, format, etc, please see youtube-dl's own [configuration](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#configuration)
